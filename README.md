HotelSystem
===========

Information System for hotels written in Python using the Django framework (https://www.djangoproject.com/).

I've used the project template from Andrew McCloud (https://github.com/amccloud/django-project-skel/).

To run this:

1. Install python

2. Install django 1.8 (pip install django)

3. Install django-forms (pip install  django-formtools)

3. Run "python manage.py runserver 8080"

4. Open "localhost:8008/hotel" in your browser.

5. To log on to administration use User: admin, Password: admin


If you are new to Django please refer to: https://docs.djangoproject.com/
