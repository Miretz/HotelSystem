HotelSystem
===========

Information System for hotels written in Django.
I've used the project template from Andrew McCloud (https://github.com/amccloud/django-project-skel/).

To run this:
1. Install python 2.7.3
2. Install django 1.4
3. Run "python manage.py runserver 8080"
4. Open "localhost:8008/hotel" in your browser.

If you are new to Django please refer to: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/
